<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Our Meeting times are Friday's @ 1:30 pm in the Engineering Building of NAU, feel free to drop by.<br />
<br />
We at NAU Robotics strive for creativity and a fun environment. Originally called the FIRST Robotics club, this club was founded by President Hannah Kosinsky in the Fall of 2011. The club was created to work in tandem with the international FIRST program. Our club members volunteered at local K-12 schools that had a need for a mentor, and they volunteered at local FIRST events.<br />
<br />
In the case of miscommunication, the club was not reactivated for the second year, but eventually was started back up with the help of Dwayne Codding, the second President. He has since then become our club organizer, and still remains a big part of our club. <br />
<br />
Presently, the club was renamed as the Lumber Trons, and Nicholas Finch was elected as the current club president. He currently is putting in his best effort to make this a fun and rewarding year for the Lumber Trons, which includes the introduction of group projects for NAU students interested in robotics.<br />
<br />
So come on down to our Lumbertrons Club and enjoy a few minutes with us.<br />
<br />
