  Welcome to our second week to Robotics club. It was a quiet meeting last week. But if you can come down, we'll be learning about microcontrollers. This should be a fun day, as i've set time aside to build a <a href="PPoint/NAU ROBOTICS  - If I only had a brain.pptx">powerpoint</a> to present on this day.<br />
  <br />
  My name is Nicholas, I'll be teaching you the basics of robotics, and hopefully the part where we build an actual robot, all before the end of the semester. I have a few ideas in mind, and if you have an idea yourself please shout at me.<br />
  <br />
  Also, no one has been complaining about scheduling conflicts. Please, if there are scheduling conflicts; email me, I want to know.<br />
  <br />
  Welcome to Week 2 [second meeting].
