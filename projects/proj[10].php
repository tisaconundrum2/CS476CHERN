<img src="pics/Arm.png" alt="Here's the arm, in case the video doesn't load" width="400" >
<br /> Join us as we attempt to flesh out a robotic arm that moves and rotates.<br />This particular design was created through the popular program called Alice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time: During Club hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location: Room 224
<br />
<br />
 Update: After subsequent tries to get the servos to work, and the board to function correctly, and all of it failing,
I've decided to let it go. We as a club can always revisit and possibly resurrect this project in the future. But for right now
it will remain dormant until someone wishes to bring it back to the surface.
