  Welcome new members and old members alike, here's a warm welcome to the new people who have chosen NAU as their school, you've made an excellent choice. <br />
  <br />
  My name is Nicholas, I'll be teaching you the basics of robotics, and hopefully the part where we build an actual robot, all before the end of the semester. I have a few ideas in mind, but it will require the help of everyone. If people are willing to stay committed we'll be able to work on some large scale projects. On the flip side, I'm going to try and keep lectures short this year. It was practically dunkin donuts with the amount of glazed eyes we had in the room last year. <br />
  <br />
  As a final note before I layout the plan for this semester, I would like to remind people that the <a href="index.php">website</a> has <a href="Past_projects.php">previous projects</a> available. If there is something on this page that strikes you as interesting please let me know and I'll try to sneak it into the lecture. <br />
  <br />
  Anyways, here is the general plan for the upcoming semester. This is not a plan that's set in stone, so if people are wanting to start right away on building a robot we can do that. This is just a suggested plan as I would figure some ground knowledge on how things work would be nice. We will discuss more during Week 0 [first meeting].
