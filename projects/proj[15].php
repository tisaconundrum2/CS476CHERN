  Welcome to our third week to Robotics club. Thank you to those of you who came last week. This week we'll be learning about proximity sensors and even programming one ourselves. I also have another powerpoint I made for you peeps.<br />
  <br />
  Again, my name is Nicholas, I'll be teaching you the basics of robotics, If you can bring in money this week (~$12) we can buy our first robots online. If you have any ideas about this year's robotics ideas please do a shout.<br />
  <br />
  Also scheduling conflicts. Please, if there are scheduling conflicts; email me, I want to know.<br />
  <br />
