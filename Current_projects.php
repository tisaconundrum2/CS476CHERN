  Welcome to our fourth/fifth week to the Robotics club. Sorry there was no club last week. Wasn't feeling well. Come today and learn a little more about microcontrollers! This should be a fun day, we'll be learning about microcontrollers and how they work. <a href="../CS476/PPoint/Microcontrollers.pptx">powerpoint</a> attached.<br />
  <br />
  My name is Nicholas, I'll be teaching you the basics of robotics, and hopefully the part where we build an actual robot, all before the end of the semester. I have a few ideas in mind, and if you have an idea yourself please shout at me.<br />
  <br />
  Also, no one has been complaining about scheduling conflicts. Please, if there are scheduling conflicts; email me, I want to know.<br />
  <br />
  Welcome to Week 4/5 [3rd meeting].
